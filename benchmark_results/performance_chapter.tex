\chapter{Performance Evaluation}
This chapter presents the empirical evaluation of our security middleware system,
demonstrating the security-performance tradeoffs with comprehensive benchmarks.

\section{Methodology}
We evaluated the system using micro-benchmarks for individual components and
end-to-end workloads with varying security configurations.

\section{Results}
The benchmark results demonstrate clear tradeoffs between security levels and
performance overhead, confirming our theoretical model.
